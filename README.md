# Advanced-Landslide-Detection-Using-InSAR-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques-

The study addresses landslide damage in hilly regions using advanced detection methods by integrating Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data with deep learning. A U-Net model, developed using TensorFlow and Keras with 100 epochs, achieves effective segmentation performance, as shown below:

| **Metric**   | **Value** |
|--------------|-----------|
| Accuracy     | 98.81     |
| Precision    | 0.803     |
| F1-score     | 0.710     |
| Loss         | 0.034     |
| Recall       | 0.641     |
